        <h3>Samantha Nicole Antopina Balandra</h3>
        <p>
          I’m Sam, 20 years old, currently studying Information Technology since 2021. I have experience in web development, Java, C#, and UI/UX design. My hobbies include singing, dancing, video editing (AMVs and manga animations), playing badminton, and learning music through guitar and piano. I aim to grow as a web developer or UI/UX designer, continuously improving my coding and design skills despite the challenges.

    <h2 class="headings">My Experiences in Programming</h2>
    <p>
      When I first started learning programming, I found it exciting—even though I often felt confused at times. With consistent practice, I realized that coding can actually be enjoyable. So far, I’ve learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and Java. While Java was challenging, it helped me strengthen my problem-solving and critical thinking skills. My goal is to continue expanding my skills by exploring other programming languages while also improving my current knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Java.

Recently, I became a member of the University of Mindanao Student Developer Community (UMSDC), an organization that supports student growth in technology. This opportunity allows me to enhance my skills and align them with my interests. In addition, I am a certified Information Technology Specialist in Database, which further motivates me to keep improving as I work toward my career goals.
